表达“捷径”
An “on-ramp” is a section of road that allows vehicles to enter a highway or freeway. In a broader, metaphorical sense, “on-ramp” can also refer to a way of entering or starting something, like gaining access to a new career or system. “匝道”是允许车辆进入高速公路的一段道路。从更广泛的比喻意义上讲，“匝道”也可以指进入或开始某事的方法，比如获得进入新职业或系统的机会。
